\section*{General Remarks}
This final Lab report includes the answers for the exercises (base grad denoted in paranthesis):
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{-1}
    \item Introductory exercise (0.5)
    \item Poisson solver (1.75)
    \item Finite elements simulation (1.0)
    \item Eigenvalue solution by Power Method on GPU (1.75)
\end{enumerate}
The optional \textbf{shining points} (e.g., performance analysis, optimization, discussion, and
clarifying figures) which yield further points are usually marked by a small colored heading in the text or an additional note is added under a figure or table. For example:\\
\Shining{This is a shining point.} \\

\textbf{N.B.} \underline{The whole repository is available on \hrefu{https://github.com/etschgi1/HPC}{GitHub}}. The report would have been far to long if all the scripts used for analysis would have been listed in the appendix. Yet, I've listed all important files, on which MPI / CUDA work has been done and some extra exemplary scripts.\\

Furthermore, if not stated otherwise the code is run on the \textbf{Delft Blue} supercomputer. Due to exessive load on the system some tests (additionally denoted) and especially the development of the code was done on the local machine. \\

In an attempt to keep the file size of this report relatively low the plots created with matplitlib were saved as pngs.
