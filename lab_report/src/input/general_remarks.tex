\section*{General Remarks}
This final Lab report includes the answers for the exercises (base grad denoted in paranthesis):
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{-1}
    \item Introductory exercise (0.5)
    \item Poisson solver (1.75)
    \item Finite elements simulation (1.0)
    \item Eigenvalue solution by Power Method on GPU (1.75)
\end{enumerate}
The optional \textbf{shining points} (e.g., performance analysis, optimization, discussion, and
clarifying figures) which yield further points are usually marked by a small colored heading in the text or an additional note is added under a figure or table. For example:\\\Shining{This is a shining point.} 

\textbf{N.B.} The whole repository is available on \href{https://github.com/etschgi1/HPC}{GitHub}.\\
Furthermore, if not stated otherwise the code is run on the \textbf{Delft Blue} supercomputer. Due to exessive load on the system some tests (additionally denoted) and especially the development of the code was done on the local machine.
